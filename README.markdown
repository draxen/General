To build General, you need to obtain the following dependencies and put them in a ../lib folder relative
to the root directory of the repository:

* BOSEconomy.jar
* craftbukkit.jar
* Help.jar
* iConomy.jar (for iConomy 5)
* iConomy4.jar
* Permission.jar
* WorldEdit.jar

Once you have done this, you can build with ant. For a full build, type
```ant dist
```
