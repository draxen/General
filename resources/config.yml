# This section lets you restrict certain items to particular groups in the /give command.
# The group '.isop' is understood as meaning the person must be an op to request that item.
# The default configuration shown here restricts items that either are not an item (ie they
# have a different ID for the corresponding inventory item) or are duplicates of another
# item (eg the burning furnace). It also restricts bedrock and fluids.
# 
# Note that this only blocks the user from using the /give command to get these items.
# If they are obtained in any other way, there is nothing to prevent the user from
# placing them. Use WorldGuard for that.
