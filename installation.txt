General Plugin for Bukkit
=========================
Version 3.6 [Schoenberg]

Installation
------------

Installation is as simple as dropping the jar into your plugins folder.
If you are using CommandHelper and wish to use the provided aliases,
simply open the command-helper.txt in the default configs folder and
copy its contents into the config.txt folder in your CommandHelper folder.

You don't need to worry about the other stuff in that folder unless you
get an error when General attempts to start up and generate the default
configuration files.

Permissions

full list.
